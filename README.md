Application that randomly generates passwords depending on user's desired length and character preference. 

---

## Description

Random Password Generator is a web app that creates random passwords for user's convenience. The user selects whether to include certain character sets (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numeric characters, and/or special characters) as possible characters in the password, and selects the desired length between 8 and 128 characters for the password. Guarantees at least one of each desired character type in the returned password. The app has responsive functionality and is convenient for use in a mobile browser.

Users can create as many random passwords as desired at the push of a button. The program uses the confirm, prompt, and alert methods to guide user through password creation, and displays generated passwords to the user.
